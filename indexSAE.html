        Culture is a fundamental aspect of every country, and it goes without saying that each country wants to promote it, but sometimes it even notise or even remain inaccessible due to the lack of information about all the cultural opportunities that countries have to offer.

        This is why we choose one of the most visited countries in the world: France. Although everyone knows France and its iconic monuments, there are many places and cultural events throughout this country. Each region has all types of events suitable for everyone, from history or art museums to music or theater festivals.

        Of course, physically, places of culture are full of history that deserves to be present to discover them. This is why they are suitable for all needs, such as reduced mobility, with ramps and elevators. There are also mobile exhibitions that travel throughout France, giving an opportunity to those who do not have the time or cannot travel very far to visit them. The texts are often translated into Braille, or audio and translations in different languages are also often available, allowing foreigners to discover the history of the place or object, there are also light shows, musical shows, or even artistic not needing translation, allowing that physically everyone can access the culture.

        Having so much to offer, France may lack the visibility to show all the opportunities. Therefore, for the interest of young people, there are a large number of festivals taking place in each region taking place in several periods.

        It is self-evident to look for what is best for you, there are many festivals that explore different languages whether foreign or even connected with old ones. They are all on social networks where you can find all the information available on each festival. There are also their own web pages where you can buy festival tickets. Of course, festivals are not the only thing there is: we have museums, churches and cathedrals, specialties typical of each region, theaters just waiting to be discovered.
